# MessianicChords

Messianic Chords is the place you go on the web for guitar chords, lyrics, and sheet music for Messianic Jewish music.

The site is built with [Lit](https://lit.dev) and ASP.NET Core. The front-end is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that [works offline](https://debuggerdotbreak.judahgabriel.com/2022/07/01/offline-pwas-my-adventure-beyond-the-basics/).

The front-end is based on [pwa-starter template](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter).
